Summary: It’s always helpful to identify branded terms when you’re dealing with a list of keywords. Filtering them out gives you a view on non-branded performance and potential areas of improvement.

**Any large-scale analysis of a group of keywords is always enhanced by identifying branded and non-branded keywords. Thankfully, it's simple to do in Excel.**

## The formula
Assuming your keywords are in column A, this formula should do the trick:

```
=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("BRANDNAME",A2)),"Branded","Non-branded")
```

Just replace `BRANDNAME` with the brand that you’re working, copy and paste the formula into Excel and apply it to the entire column of keywords. That’ll give you a column with either a 'Branded' or 'Non-branded' value for each keyword.~

## How it works
Let’s break down each part of the formula, working inside out. We’ll use an example set of Nike keywords to illustrate each step.

### The SEARCH function

The [SEARCH function](https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-search-function) looks for the provided string of text inside another [string](https://www.deskbright.com/excel/excel-string-functions/) of text, returning the position of the first character in the case of a match. It’s not case sensitive. In our case, `=SEARCH("nike",A2)` is asking Excel to look for the text “nike” inside our keyword text string.

If it is present, the formula will return the position of the “n” in “nike”. If it is not present, the formula will evaluate as a #VALUE! error.

### The ISNUMBER function

The [ISNUMBER function](https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-isnumber-function) simply checks that a given cell is a number, returning either TRUE or FALSE. Thus, our formula becomes `=ISNUMBER(SEARCH("nike"),A2)`:

By wrapping our `SEARCH` function with `ISNUMBER`, we’re converting the output of the former into a Boolean TRUE or FALSE value. In other words:

*   If “nike” is _present_ in keyword –> `SEARCH` returns a number –> `ISNUMBER` evaluates as TRUE
*   If “nike” is _not present_ in keyword –> `SEARCH` returns an #VALUE! error –> `ISNUMBER` evaluates as FALSE

Essentially, we’re converting the results of `SEARCH` into something we can use in the final component of the formula, our `IF` statement.

### The IF function

The [IF function](https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-if-function) uses a logical test to return one value for a TRUE result, and another for FALSE.

We bring everything together using an `IF` statement: `=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("BRANDNAME",A2)),"Branded","Non-branded")`

Our logical test is the `ISNUMBER(...)` component of the function. If that evaluates as TRUE, the `IF` statement returns “Branded”. If FALSE, it returns “Non-branded”.

**And that’s it!**

I use this function without fail when I’m dealing with lists of keywords. After reading this, hopefully you will too.
