**Text to Columns is probably one of the tools I use most frequently in my day-to-day SEO work.** 

Kudos to Distilled's [Excel for SEOs](https://www.distilled.net/excel-for-seo/) guide for inspiring this article – I'd highly recommend it to any SEOs looking to sharpen up their Excel skills. Anyway, let's get into it.

## How to use Text to Columns

I've used an Ahrefs export for [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) for this demo, but you can use Text to Columns for any dataset containing URLs or URL paths.

### 1) Format your data as a table
Highlight your dataset with `CTRL+A` and convert it into a table with CTRL+T.

(This step is optional – I find it makes the data easier to work with.)

### 2) Split out the URLs using Text to Columns
Highlight the column containing your URLs. In the top Ribbon, click on `Data` > `Text to Columns`.

That'll bring up the Text to Columns Wizard. We'll run through the steps carefully to get the desired output.

**Step 1:** leave the Wizard as is and hit `Next >`.

The option to split our text (the URLs) by a delimiter – i.e. a specified text character – is selected by default.

**Step 2:** uncheck the default delimiter (Tab) and enter a forward slash in the `Other:` input box.

This tells the Text to Columns wizard to look for forward slashes as a way of 'splitting up' your URLs. You can also check `Treat consecutive delimiters as one` to avoid an empty output column for the second slash in 'https:/**/**'.

**Step 3:** select where the output will go.

Choose the first cell in the first empty column next to your table. _Beware:_ if you proceed with Excel's default selection for the Destination cell, the newly-generated columns will overwrite whatever data you have in the columns to the right of your URLs.

And we're done!

I like to rename my columns to make analysis a little easier.

I also tend to filter the first 'subfolder' column – `Path_1` – for any blank cells and fill these in as 'homepage'.

## Analysing your data for SEO insights
You can use every SEO's best friend – a pivot table – to mine your data for useful insights. To turn your data into a pivot, highlight your table with `CTRL+A` and hit `ALT+D+P` to open up the PivotTable wizard, mashing `Enter` until a pivot table appears in a new sheet.

Let's see what we can find out about HubSpot.

**The majority of traffic goes to HubSpot's blog subdomain**

To be precise, Ahrefs estimates that almost 91% of traffic goes to its blog. Kudos to HubSpot's content creation team!

This pivot chart uses the 'Domain/subdomain' column generated by Text to Columns, aggregating traffic:

**HubSpot's blog traffic is driven by its /marketing/, /sales/ and /website/ subfolders**

This time, we've gone one level deeper to investigate the subfolders within [https://blog.hubspot.com/](https://blog.hubspot.com/). It seems that HubSpot's marketing content drives over half of of all traffic to its blog, followed by its Sales and Webmaster content.

**Almost a quarter of blog traffic is driven by featured snippets**

I've turned this final pivot table into a Bar Graph via `Insert` > `Recommended Charts` > `Clustered Column`. And wow! Almost 25% of the half a million monthly sessions to the blog come via a featured snippet. HubSpot are clearly masters at answering a user's primary question on a topic in a clear and concise manner.

There is lots more you can do with this dataset; we haven't even started incorporating keywords into our analysis yet!
