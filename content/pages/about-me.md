Summary: A potted history of my career thus far.
Slug: about-me

## Hi, I'm Freddie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a London-based SEO, currently working for Zoopla. I've been in digital marketing for about four years.

My journey began with me [presenting a virtual open day](https://www.facebook.com/unibirmingham/videos/10155811010908608 "Facebook video of me giving a campus tour for the University of Birmingham's virtual open day in 2017") at the Uni of Birmingham (`cringe warning`: watch at your peril) - fast forward a few internships, a few jobs and now we're here!

I'll be honest; I've never really done personal blogging before. This blog is an attempt to put to (virtual) paper all the useful stuff I pick up along my SEO journey (and hopefully a bit of Python, too).

My career so far
----------------

![Student Hut logo](/images/student-hut-logo.png)

I began my career at [Student Hut](https://studenthut.com/ "Student Hut homepage"), a review site for universities. I joined as Content & Social Media Exec but quickly found I was more interested in SEO than social and CRM.

It was a small company so I couldn't completely relieve myself of the social/CRM duties - we used a network of 'viral' Facebook pages plus a large mailing list for lead-gen campaigns - but found a niche in linkbuilding, teaching myself SEO basics as I went.

Taking on the role of Onsite Content & Outreach Exec, I had some success with Brian Dean's 'ego-bait' tacics, building high-quality links from universities through ['awards'-style posts](https://studenthut.com/articles/top-10-halls-residence-london "'Top 10 Halls of Residence in London' article I wrote for Student Hut").

Linkbuilding is _ever so slightly_ soul-crushing, though, and there's certainly more to SEO than outreach. So after 8 months at Student Hut I was lucky to be offered a job in Trainline's SEO team as an SEO Content Exec.

I worked at [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/ "Trainline homepage") from April 2019 to June 2021; it was a fab couple of years.

I learnt a lot at Trainline: using GA and GSC to report on performance, SEMRush for keyword research and competitor analysis, testing meta title changes and structured FAQ data, building long-form content using the Umbraco CMS and optimising Dynamic SEO pages at scale.

I also gained a really interesting perspective from inside a tech business as it went through a tumultous period in its history: floating on the London Stock Exchange in summer 2019 before being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.

Most importantly, I worked with some awesome, clever people.

![Zoopla logo](/images/zoopla-logo.png)

At [Zoopla](https://www.zoopla.com/ "Zoopla homepage") I really got stuck into Tech SEO. I work with a cross-functional team of developers and content writers to deprecate / redirect old content, optimise existing content and brief out new stuff to align with business goals.

I supported on a project to bring back a subset of ~400k pages from a blanket no-index tag - mapping out search demand using the Google Search Console API - and contributed to improving our XML sitemaps. Zoopla generates huge amounts of data every day so I also learnt a bit of SQL to pull Google Analytics data from BigQuery.

It was a very instructive experience and facilitated a pivot towards Tech SEO in my new role.

As of mid-April 2022, I'll be starting as a Tech SEO in [Wise's](https://wise.com/) Owned Sites team. 
I'll keep this blog updated as I go!
